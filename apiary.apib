# Opsee API
This is the publicly accessible API for the Opsee backend. 

# Group Signups
Signups are the resources that get created when a user first
signs up for the service.  For a signup to become an active login
they must have a verification email sent with an activation token.

# Group Environments
Environments provide a way for customers to segment their data into
different partitions. For instance, a customer might have one environment
for their production install, and a separate environment for dev.
For any resource that is owned by an environment, that resource's
path is namespaced by the environment ID.

## Environment [/environments/{id}]
A single environment.

The environment resource has the following attributes:

- id
- name
- created_at
- updated_at

The states *created_at* and *updated_at* are assigned by the Opsee API
at the moment of creation / update.  The state *id* is required to be unique
per customer, and cannot be changed once set.

+ Parameters
    + id (string) ... ID of the environment, must be a url safe string.
    
+ Model (application/json)

            {
                "id" : "url-safe-unique-identifier", 
                "name" : "The Display Name", 
                "create_at" : "2015-02-18T02:15:15Z",
                "updated_at" : "2015-02-18T02:15:15Z"
