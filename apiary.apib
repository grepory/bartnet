# Opsee API
This is the publicly accessible API for the Opsee backend. 

# Group Signups
Signups are the resources that get created when a user first
signs up for the service.  For a signup to become an active login
they must have a verification email sent with an activation token.

## Signups Collection [/signups]
### Create a Signup [POST]
+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "email": "person@gmail.com",
            "name": "person's name"
        }
        
+ Response 201 (application/json)

        {"email": "person@gmail.com"}
        
+ Response 409 (application/json)

        "Conflict: this email address is already signed up."

## Activate Signups [/signups/send-activation?email=]
### Activate a Signup [POST]

privileges. Superuser privileges are attached to the login table in the
database.

+ Parameters
    + email (string) ... Email address of the signup to activate

+ Request (application/json)
    + Headers

            Authorization: HMAC 1--2jmj7l5rSw0yVb_vlWAYkK_YBwk=

    + Body

            {"email" : "email@domain.com"}

+ Response 201

# Group Activations
The activation resource gets created when a signup is activated for
inclusion into the beta.

## Activation [/activations/{id}/activate]
### Request an Activation [GET]

Requesting an activation by ID provides confirmation that an
activation exists and has not yet been used.

+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Body

            {
                "id" : "url-safe-unique-identifier",

                "name" : "Users Name",
                "used" : false,

                "updated_at" : "2015-02-18T02:15:15Z"
            }

### Confirm an Activation [POST]

Confirming the activation using its unique ID ensures validation of the
user's email. The body of the post should be the rest of the info necessary
to create a login, the password and the customer's unique customer ID (chosen by them).
In the case that the customer ID is already taken, this resource will return
status code 409 Conflict. Upon success the activation ID will be marked used
in the database and a 201 status code returned.  The body will contain the
newly created login.

# Group Checks
Check resources provide the means for creating and pushing down health checks to a customer's
bastion hosts. Once created, health checks will be sent down to any bastions connected under
that particular customer's ID, and resent every time a bastion connection initiates. The bastion
itself is responsible for determining whether a particular check is relevant to its current
VPC or subnet.
